### Development mode

To start the shadow-cljs compiler, navigate to the project folder and run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

Shadow-cljs will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.
Once shadow-cljs starts up, you should be able to open the `public/index.html` page in the browser.


### Building for production

```
npm run release
```
